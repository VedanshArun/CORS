                    CORS proxy can be a helpful solution to make cross-origin requests. The proxy layer 
                    sits between your request and its destination without knowing the requestâ€™s origin.
                    Thus, though the request comes from an unknown source, the CORS proxy makes it seem that 
                    it is a request from an allowed location.

                    To learn how to do this, here is the list of <span className='text-decoration-line: underline font-medium'>CORS-Proxy</span> which you can use 
                    for your website.

                    Free Proxies can be great for testing, but relying on a free third-party tool is not advisable 
                    for something you will use on the production site. In such cases, a more stable solution is to 
                    call the API from a server and make the data available on the client-side.
